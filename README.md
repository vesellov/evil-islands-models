# evil-islands-models
A simple viewer for Evil Islands 3D models written in Python using Kivy framework

First you need to copy "figures.res" file from the Evil Islands game "Res/" folder into the repository folder.

Run the app via Makefile:

        make run


This will first create a fresh Python virtual environment and then start the "main.py" script.

Use mouse or touchpad gestures to rotate camera and zoom in/out.

Use keyboard buttons "z" and "x" to switch animations.
